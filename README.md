WT32SC01 display with Esphome and Home-Assistant
================================================
Example config for a WT32SC01 display using Esphome and controlling Home Assistant entities and using Home Assistant sensor to display Meteo forecast.

The meteo forecaste part is depending on a template sensor in Home Assistant. See ./sensor_ha/forecast_8hours.yaml. 
The images in ./images/weather1 should be places in the home assistant config/esphome/images/weather1 folder
